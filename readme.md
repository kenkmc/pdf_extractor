This web application is a powerful, all-in-one tool for extracting rich content from both PDF documents and images directly within the browser. Built as a single, self-contained HTML file, it leverages advanced AI vision models through an OpenAI-compatible API to perform sophisticated analysis tasks without requiring any backend server.

The program operates in two distinct modes. In **PDF Mode**, users can upload a document, select a range of pages, and initiate a comprehensive extraction. The tool not only performs high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to pull out all text—preserving formatting like headings and lists using Markdown—but it also intelligently extracts the original, high-quality images embedded within each page. Going a step further, it automatically runs object detection on these extracted images, identifying and labeling key patterns within them.

In **Image Mode**, the application offers more focused tools. Users can upload an image file or simply paste one from their clipboard. From there, they have two options: perform a quick OCR to get all the text, or run a detailed pattern analysis. The standout feature is an interactive, resizable selection box that allows users to precisely define a region of interest on any displayed image. Once a region is selected, the tool sends just that portion for AI analysis, appending the identified objects below the main image. This process can be repeated, allowing for multiple, iterative analyses on different parts of the same image.

The results are presented in a clean, interactive format. Identified objects are displayed in organized cards with checkboxes, enabling batch operations like deleting unwanted items or downloading multiple selections as a single ZIP file. For text-based results, users have the convenience of a one-click "Copy All Text" button and a "Download as .docx" feature, making it a versatile and efficient solution for any content extraction need.
